# mental-health-data-unsupervised-learning-algorithm
Understanding the problem of mental health in tech realated companies in form of a case study by applying Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm to derive information from a provided dataset in a survey downloaded from Kaggle website.
### This is a process of carrying out unsupervised learning on a dataset for a case study.
#### Main steps: -
- Data Cleaning : - understanding and grouping of features, getting rid of features with too much null values. 
- Feature Engineering: - Imputation of missing values using statistical functions and encoding of features
- Feature Selection: - selecting of important features and getting rid of irrelevant features using feature variance
- Clustering: - visualizing of learned model in form of clusters
